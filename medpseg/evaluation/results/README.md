Evaluation outputs will be saved here when running reproduce evaluation.
The files present here are results achieved when running in the author's environment.
Note that some results are slightly different (0.00x variations) when using pre-processed .png instead of direct HU values, due to 
conversions from int16 to uint8 and back.
